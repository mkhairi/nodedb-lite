//! Gate test: a write to an unrelated second collection, interleaved between
//! `document_put` calls on the collection under test, must not stall
//! replication of that collection to Origin.
//!
//! Both tests insert 3 documents into a bitemporal collection (`probe`) and
//! assert Origin ends up with 3 rows. The only difference between them is
//! whether a KV write to a second collection (`signals`) is interleaved
//! between each `document_put`. Keeping the two variants side by side is
//! what makes a causal-completeness regression diagnosable: the
//! documents-only variant isolates the `probe` sync path, and the
//! interleaved variant proves that a write to an entirely different
//! collection cannot leave `probe`'s own deltas looking causally incomplete
//! to Origin (which would otherwise buffer them indefinitely, waiting for a
//! dependency that will never arrive from `signals`).
//!
//! ## How to run
//!
//! Build the Origin binary first:
//! ```text
//! cd <project-root>/nodedb && cargo build -p nodedb
//! ```
//! Then run from the nodedb-lite workspace root:
//! ```text
//! cargo nextest run -p nodedb-lite --test sync_interop_cross_collection
//! ```
//!
//! The test is placed in the `heavy` nextest group (serialized) by the
//! `binary(/sync_interop/)` filter in `.config/nextest.toml`.
