//! Atomic transaction batch and Calvin deterministic execution for Lite.
//!
//! On Origin these are dispatched by the Multi-Raft sequencer to guarantee
//! deterministic ordering across shards. On Lite there is only one shard and
//! one writer — single-node execution is already deterministic. All three
//! Calvin variants and `TransactionBatch` collapse to the same operation:
//! execute each physical plan in order, short-circuiting on the first error.
//!
//! "Atomicity" on Lite is provided by executing plans sequentially while
//! holding the engine's existing mutexes (CrdtEngine, StrictEngine, etc.).
//! Because there is no concurrent writer, the sequence is equivalent to a
//! single atomic commit.
