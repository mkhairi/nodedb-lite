//! `NodeDbLite::start_auto_compact` — background storage-compaction task.

impl<S: StorageEngine> NodeDbLite<S> {
    /// Start a background task that calls the global `compact()` every
    /// `interval_ms` milliseconds, reclaiming dead pages and truncating the
    /// backing file so on-disk growth stays bounded.
    ///
    /// # When to use
    ///
    /// Compaction is opt-in and unnecessary for most workloads. Enable it when
    /// writing one commit per entry, where the pagedb deferred-free list would
    /// otherwise accumulate and the file would grow without bound. For engines
    /// with nothing to compact (in-memory / test stores) the call is a cheap
    /// no-op every tick.
    ///
    /// # Cost vs. auto-flush
    ///
    /// This is heavier than `start_auto_flush`: compaction repacks the B+ trees
    /// and truncates the file, and it no-ops while a reader pins the reclaimable
    /// page range. Use a much larger interval than the flush interval — minutes,
    /// not seconds.
    ///
    /// # Usage
    ///
    /// The `open*` constructors already start this task from
    /// [`LiteConfig::auto_compact_ms`](crate::config::LiteConfig::auto_compact_ms),
    /// which defaults to 0 (disabled). Set that field to enable compaction:
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// let config = LiteConfig { auto_compact_ms: 300_000, ..LiteConfig::default() };
    /// let db = NodeDbLite::open_with_config(storage, config).await?;
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Calling this directly spawns an additional task rather than replacing a
    /// running one.
    ///
    /// # Task lifecycle
    ///
    /// The task is registered with the database's task registry, so
    /// [`NodeDbLite::shutdown`](crate::NodeDbLite::shutdown) stops it before
    /// the host drops its async runtime. It also holds a `Weak` reference, so
    /// a database dropped without a shutdown still ends the loop at its next
    /// tick rather than keeping the database alive.
    ///
    /// # Disabling
    ///
    /// Pass `interval_ms = 0` to skip spawning entirely (auto-compaction
    /// disabled — the default). Compaction can still be triggered manually via
    /// `compact()`.
