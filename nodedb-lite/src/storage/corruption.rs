//! What to do when opening a store that cannot be read.
//!
//! An embedded database is frequently the only copy of its data. Whether a
//! damaged store can be thrown away and rebuilt depends on something only the
//! embedder knows — whether an Origin exists to re-sync from, whether the data
//! is reproducible, whether starting empty is worse than not starting. So the
//! library reports the fault and stops; discarding is a decision the caller
//! makes, in advance, by name.
//!
//! Note that "does this store sync?" is not something the library can infer at
//! open time. `LiteConfig::sync_enabled` governs whether writes record
//! themselves for the push to Origin, not whether an Origin has ever been
//! reachable, and `start_sync` is called after open in any case. Treating either as consent to discard would
//! reintroduce exactly the silent decision this type exists to prevent.
