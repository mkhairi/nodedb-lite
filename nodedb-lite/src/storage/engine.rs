//! `StorageEngine` trait: the async key-value blob interface.
//!
//! All persistent storage on the edge goes through this trait. pagedb is the
//! backend on every target — native via platform async I/O and WASM via the
//! OPFS worker. The engines above (HNSW, CSR, Loro) serialize their data to
//! opaque blobs and store them here. The storage layer never interprets the
//! data.
