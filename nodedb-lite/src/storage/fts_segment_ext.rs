//! `FtsSegmentExt` — pagedb segment operations for FTS memtable posting data.
//!
//! The `StorageEngine` trait handles sparse, sorted, key-value state. For FTS
//! posting data (potentially large per-index blobs, sequentially read on
//! cold-open restore) pagedb segments are the appropriate backing.  Bundling
//! all term postings for one index key into a single segment reduces B+ tree
//! pressure from O(vocab_size) entries to O(1) per index key.
//!
//! Term dictionary entries, doc-length tables, surrogate maps, and collection
//! metadata remain on the B+ tree (`Namespace::Fts`) — they are genuinely
//! sparse and sorted.
//!
//! Only compiled on non-WASM targets.  WASM stays on the KV blob path.
