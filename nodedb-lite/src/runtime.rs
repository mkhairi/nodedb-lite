//! Platform-specific async runtime abstractions.
//!
//! NodeDB-Lite compiles for native (Tokio) and WASM (`wasm-bindgen-futures`).
//! This module provides a thin abstraction over the differences so engine
//! code doesn't need `#[cfg]` everywhere.
//!
//! **Native (iOS/Android/Desktop):** Tokio — `spawn`, `spawn_blocking`, `sleep`, `interval`.
//! **WASM (Browser):** `wasm-bindgen-futures` + `gloo-timers` — `spawn_local`, no blocking
//! threads, timer-backed sleep and interval.
