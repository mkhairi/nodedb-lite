//! # NodeDB-Lite
//!
//! Embedded, offline-first build of NodeDB for phones, browsers (WASM), and
//! desktops. A single in-process library exposing the same [`NodeDb`] trait as
//! the Origin server — document, key-value, vector, graph, full-text, spatial,
//! columnar, timeseries, and array engines over one storage core — with CRDT
//! sync to an Origin server over WebSocket.
//!
//! ## Quick start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use nodedb_lite::{NodeDbLite, PagedbStorageMem};
//! use nodedb_client::NodeDb;
//!
//! # async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let storage = PagedbStorageMem::open_in_memory().await?;
//! let db = NodeDbLite::open(storage).await?;
//! db.execute_sql("CREATE COLLECTION notes", &[]).await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Durability
//!
//! Strict row writes commit before returning success. Native filesystem pagedb commits survive reopening without an explicit flush.
//! Generic storage backends provide their own commit durability guarantees.
//!
//! Ordinary document and CRDT writes remain buffered. Unindexed `kv_put` and all `kv_delete` calls also remain buffered.
//! Indexed KV puts and SQL KV writes commit directly. Vector rows persist during insertion.
//! [`NodeDbLite::flush`] applies buffered document, CRDT, and KV state and persists derived engine checkpoints.
//!
//! Derived full-text, vector, and spatial checkpoints remain separate from strict row commits.
//! Later maintenance errors do not roll back committed strict rows.
//!
//! The `open*` constructors return `Arc<NodeDbLite>` and schedule automatic flushes through [`config::LiteConfig::auto_flush_ms`].
//! The default interval is one second. Scheduling delays and storage errors prevent a hard wall-clock durability bound.
//! The task holds a `Weak` handle and stops when the last `Arc` disappears.
//! Set `auto_flush_ms` to 0 for manual flushing. Call [`NodeDbLite::flush`] before dropping buffered state.
//!
