//! `KvPushAck` dispatch: Origin's answer to one `KvPush`.
//!
//! - `Applied` / `Duplicate`: the write is on Origin. The stream frontier
//!   advances and the write is retired.
//! - `Accepted`: provisional. The write stays in flight.
//! - `Fenced`: this producer is fenced, and the push halts.
//! - `Gap`: Origin expects an earlier seq. Every in-flight write is re-sent
//!   from the oldest, and Origin drops the ones it already applied.
//! - `Rejected`: Origin refused the write for good. It is logged at ERROR
//!   with Origin's reason and retired, the way every engine queue handles a
//!   terminal refusal. The write stays in this replica's KV store.
