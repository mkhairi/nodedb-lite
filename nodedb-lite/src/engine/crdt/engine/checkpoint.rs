//! What each flush writes for the CRDT layer: an incremental update in the
//! common case, a full snapshot only when the updates have earned one.
//!
//! A Loro snapshot export costs O(document). Writing one per flush therefore
//! costs the size of the whole collection every `auto_flush_ms`, whatever the
//! write rate was — the term that produced both unbounded file growth and a
//! flush that held the reader-visible lock for all wall time. An update export
//! costs O(new operations), so the same tick under the same load writes what
//! actually changed.
//!
//! The base snapshot is still rewritten periodically. Restore replays every
//! delta written since the base, so letting deltas accumulate without bound
//! moves the cost from flush to open. Rewriting once the deltas reach a
//! fraction of the base keeps that replay bounded by roughly the same
//! fraction, and amortises the O(document) export over the writes that made it
//! necessary.
