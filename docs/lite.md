# NodeDB-Lite

NodeDB-Lite is a fully capable embedded database for edge devices — phones, tablets, browsers, and desktops. It runs all seven engines in-process with sub-millisecond reads, no server required. Offline-first with CRDT sync to Origin when connectivity returns.

## When to Use

- Mobile apps that need to work offline
- AI agents that need local memory (vectors + graph + documents)
- Browser-based apps (WASM)
- Desktop applications with local-first data
- IoT gateways with intermittent connectivity

## Platforms

| Platform                                  | Backend                   | Binary Size                                                        |

| iOS _(in progress — not in 0.1.0)_ | redb + C FFI (cbindgen)   | Native _(requires macOS build environment — not yet built/tested)_ |
| Android                                   | redb + C FFI + Kotlin/JNI | Native                                                             |
| Browser (WASM)                            | redb (in-memory + OPFS)   | ~4.5 MB                                                            |

## Key Features

- **All engines locally** — Vector search, graph traversal, document CRUD, full-text search, timeseries, spatial, KV — all in-process, no network
- **Sub-millisecond reads** — Hot data lives in memory indexes (HNSW, CSR, Loro)
- **CRDT sync** — Every write produces a delta. Deltas sync to Origin over WebSocket when online. Multiple devices converge regardless of operation order.
- **Shape subscriptions** — Control what data each device holds: `WHERE user_id = $me`, not the entire database
- **Conflict resolution** — Declarative per-collection policies. SQL constraints (UNIQUE, FK) enforced on Origin at sync time with typed compensation hints back to the device.
- **Encryption at rest** — AES-256-GCM + Argon2id key derivation
- **Memory governance** — Per-engine budgets, pressure levels, LRU eviction
- **SQL** — Supports a documented subset of NodeDB's SQL surface. See the SQL compatibility matrix for the full list of supported plan types; complex queries (JOIN, CTE, window functions, aggregates) run against Origin via the remote `NodeDb` client.

## Same API, Any Runtime

The `NodeDb` trait is identical across Lite and Origin. Application code doesn't change for the operations both implementations expose; Origin offers more (full SQL, Array DDL/DML, vector quantization, distributed search). See the support matrix for the Lite-side surface.

```rust
// Works with both NodeDbLite (in-process) and NodeDbRemote (over network)
async fn search(db: &dyn NodeDb, query: &[f32]) -> Result<Vec<Article>> {
    db.vector_search("articles", query, 10).await
}
```

Moving from embedded to server is a connection string change, not a rewrite.

## Sync Architecture

```
Offline:    App writes locally -> Loro generates delta -> delta persisted to redb
Reconnect:  Device opens WebSocket -> sends vector clock + accumulated deltas
Cloud:      Origin validates (RLS, UNIQUE, FK) -> merges -> pushes back missed changes
Conflict:   Rejected deltas -> dead-letter queue + CompensationHint -> device handles
Converged:  Device and cloud share identical Loro state hash
```

Sync features:

- ACK-based flow control (AIMD)
- CRC32C delta integrity
- JWT token refresh during sync
- Replay dedup and sequence gap detection
- Rate limiting and downstream throttle

## Performance Targets

| Metric                                | Target                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Vector search (1K vectors, 384d, k=5) | < 1ms p99               |
| Graph BFS (10K edges, 2 hops)         | < 1ms p99               |
| Document get                          | < 0.1ms                 |
| Cold start (10K vectors + 100K edges) | < 500ms                 |
| Sync round-trip (single delta)        | < 200ms                 |
| WASM bundle                           | ~4.5 MB                 |
| Mobile memory                         | < 100 MB (configurable) |

## Search Index Declarations

Lite SQL supports one anonymous search declaration per document or strict collection.

```sql
CREATE SEARCH INDEX ON articles (title, body) ANALYZER 'standard' FUZZY false;
DROP SEARCH INDEX IF EXISTS fts_articles;
```

| Clause | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Field list | Indexes selected top-level string fields in existing and future rows. |
| `ANALYZER` | Uses a registered analyzer name. The default is `standard`. |
| `FUZZY` | Uses bare `true` or `false`. The default is `false`. |
| Index name | Uses `fts_<collection>`. Quoted collection names preserve case. |
| `DROP` | Reindexes every top-level string field with `standard` and `false` defaults. |
| Collection type | Supports ordinary documents, bitemporal documents, and strict rows. Columnar declarations return an error. |

Declarations persist across reopen, including collections without rows. Duplicate creation returns an error. Missing fields remain eligible for future string values.

Searches continue against the previous index during rebuilding. Coordinated source writes wait for declaration publication. Synchronous mutation APIs return a busy error before mutation.

Cancellation before admission leaves the declaration unchanged. After admission, the owned declaration task completes storage and publication even when its caller cancels. Runtime termination interrupts tasks, and reopening recovers from persisted declarations.

## FFI and WASM

**C FFI** (`nodedb-lite-ffi`) — 12 extern functions with cbindgen-generated header. Kotlin/JNI bridge for Android.

**WASM** (`nodedb-lite-wasm`) — JavaScript/TypeScript API via wasm-bindgen. redb runs in-memory with optional OPFS persistence in browsers.
